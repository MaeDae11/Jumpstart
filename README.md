# Jumpstart
Codecademy Final Project: Webpage focusing on jQuery, JavaScript and CSS


<b>Overall:</b>
  <li>Specifications: layout was provided, as well as, photos. However, I did not complete the project using primarily Bootstrap as I preferred additional practice in Flexbox and have completed many projects with Bootstrap.</li>
  <li>Concept: the webpage focused on completing projects and needing ideas to get started. It incorporates art, photography and more.</li>


<b>Features:</b>
  <li>CSS hover on images was informational and I have taken that knowledge to other projects.</li>
  <li>Overflow combined with hover and zoom placed on the images. This created a magnifying effect without letting the picture overflow outside it's container.</li>
  <li>Opacity for an additional effect on the images on hover.</li>
  <li>Slicks' carousel with jQuery to create multiple images to scroll across page. Very customizable and would love to use in the future.</li>
  <li>Bootstrap for standard, reactive button design.</li>



<b>Difficulties:</b>
  <li>The carousel from Slick created the most difficulty for Jumpstart. Since Slick blended newly learned jQuery aspects while using a script from Slick. This lead to confusion as I simply thought I was incorporating the code incorrectly. Although, it ended up being that their script links no longer worked. While this hurtle was frustrating, I learned to triple check links if everything else seems fine. </li>
  <li>Working with overflow of images and learning to maniuplate them in a new way</li>
