Codecademy Final Project: Webpage focusing on jQuery, JavaScript and CSS


<b>Overall:</b>
- This was the final project for the Front End Web Development 8 week course. 
- Specifications: layout was provided, as well as, photos. However, I did not complete the project using primarily Bootstrap as I preferred additional practice in Flexbox and have completed many projects with Bootstrap.
- Concept: the webpage focused on completing projects and needing ideas to get started. It incorporates art, photography and more.

<ul>Features
  <li>CSS hover on images was informational and I have taken that knowledge to other projects.</li>
  <li>Overflow combined with hover and zoom placed on the images. This created a magnifying effect without letting the picture overflow outside it's container.</li>
  <li>Carousel with jQuery to create multiple images to scroll across page.</li>
  <li>Bootstrap for unique button design.</li>
</ul>
